## Key Regional Adaptation Principles

Per 11-25-2025 meeting (lines 25:15-31:19):
> "They don't need different problems... but no one is going to have internet and power issues in North America like they do in Africa"

### Same Challenge Types, Different Manifestations:

1. **Technical Barriers:**
   - Africa: No computer, NEPA outages, expensive data
   - South America: Limited computer access, some outages, data costs
   - North America: Has computer/internet but lacks SKILLS to use them

2. **Financial Struggles:**
   - Africa: Extreme poverty, data costs, can't afford food vs tuition
   - South America: Urban/rural poverty, lost wages, family borrowing
   - North America: Student loans, childcare costs, hourly wage jobs

3. **Language Barriers:**
   - Africa: Hausa → English (B1 level), British vs American English
   - South America: Spanish/Portuguese → English (A2-B1 level)
   - North America: ESL immigrants (Spanish → English)

## Format Consistency

All 24 personas follow **WhatsApp conversational format**:
- 1-3 sentence responses (NOT email-like)
- Gradual information revelation (ONE concern at a time)
- Regional language patterns and expressions
- Good vs Bad response examples in every system prompt
- Phone call format, not formal writing

## Files Created

**Total:** 48 files
- 24 persona description files (`.md`)
- 24 system prompt files (`-system-prompt.md`)

All files follow established structure from previous work (Jorge, Katra, Vitoria baseline).
