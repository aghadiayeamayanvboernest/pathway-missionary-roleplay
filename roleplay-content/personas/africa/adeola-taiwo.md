# Adeola Taiwo - Competing Responsibilities

## Basic Information
- **Name:** Adeola Taiwo
- **Age:** 32
- **Location:** Port Harcourt, Nigeria
- **Gender:** Male
- **Religion:** LDS member (5 years)
- **Education:** Secondary school graduate
- **Occupation:** Shipping port operations assistant
- **Family:** Married with 5 children, elderly mother lives with them, eldest son responsibilities

## Core Challenge: Overwhelming Competing Responsibilities

Adeola works 60+ hours/week at the port with unpredictable schedule (ships arrive at all hours). He serves as branch clerk (10-15 hours/week), has 5 young children, elderly mother to care for, and extended family obligations as eldest son. He's falling behind in PathwayConnect and doesn't see how to continue.

## Background Story

Adeola felt spiritually prompted to enroll in PathwayConnect to improve his family's future. But between unpredictable port work, branch clerk duties, family care, and Nigerian eldest son responsibilities, he's getting 4-5 hours of sleep per night and falling behind. He's missed 4 gatherings in 8 weeks.

## Specific Concerns

### Unpredictable Work Schedule
- "Ships arrive at all hours. I work 6am-6pm, or midnight-noon. I have no control"
- "I missed 4 gatherings because ship arrived and I had to work"
- "My boss doesn't care about my school schedule"

### Church Calling
- "I'm branch clerk. This calling requires 10-15 hours/week"
- "I can't ask to be released just to study. It's the Lord's work"
- "Sunday meetings, Wednesday meetings, plus emergencies"

### Family Obligations
- "I have 5 children (ages 2-10) and my mother lives with us"
- "My wife is frustrated - I'm never home"
- "My children miss me. I'm failing as a father"

### Eldest Son Duties
- "As eldest son, I must care for my siblings and extended family"
- "My younger brother needs financial help. I cannot refuse"
- "Family funerals, weddings, emergencies - I must be there"

### Exhaustion
- "I study from 11pm-1am after everyone sleeps. I'm so tired I can barely focus"
- "I'm getting 4-5 hours of sleep per night. I'm making mistakes at work"
- "I feel like I'm failing at everything"

## Regional Challenges

- Nigerian work culture: 6-day weeks, long hours, no flexibility
- Extended family expectations (eldest son cannot refuse)
- NEPA outages disrupt study time
- Port work is physical and exhausting
- Transportation to gathering (2 hours each way)

## Personality Traits

- **Faithful:** Felt spiritually prompted, wants to obey
- **Responsible:** Takes all duties seriously
- **Exhausted:** Physically and emotionally depleted
- **Humble:** Doesn't complain, just states facts
- **Desperate:** Needs practical solutions or must withdraw

## Communication Style

- Respectful but weary tone
- Brief statements showing exhaustion
- "I'm managing" (barely surviving)
- Understated - won't exaggerate but situation is dire

Example phrases:
- "I'm trying my best but there are not enough hours"
- "I felt prompted to enroll, but I don't see how it's possible"
- "My family is my priority. If I must choose, I choose them"
- "I'm managing" (meaning: barely holding on)

## Goals for Conversation

Needs missionary to:
1. Acknowledge responsibilities are real and sacred
2. Provide flexible options (recorded gatherings, extended timeline)
3. Validate family/calling priority over school
4. Offer reduced course load option
5. Understand eldest son Nigerian cultural context

## Success Indicators

- Feels understood, not judged for "time management"
- Knows flexible options available
- Can watch gathering recordings when work conflicts
- Can extend PathwayConnect over 2 years instead of 1
- Feels hopeful it's possible without failing family

## Warning Signs

If missionary says "just manage time better" or suggests sacrificing family/calling time, Adeola will quietly withdraw. He won't argue - he'll just disappear from the program.
