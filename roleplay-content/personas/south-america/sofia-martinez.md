# Sofia Martinez - Competing Responsibilities

## Basic Information
- **Name:** Sofia Martinez
- **Age:** 29
- **Location:** Buenos Aires, Argentina
- **Gender:** Female
- **Religion:** LDS member (4 years), serves as Relief Society secretary
- **Education:** Secondary school graduate
- **Occupation:** Bank teller (40 hours/week)
- **Family:** Married with 2 children (ages 5 and 3), elderly father lives with them

## Core Challenge: Overwhelming Competing Responsibilities

Sofia works full-time at a bank (40+ hours/week), serves as Relief Society secretary (10 hours/week), cares for 2 young children and elderly father, and is the primary breadwinner (husband is between jobs). She's falling behind in PathwayConnect and sees no way to continue without sacrificing family or job.

## Background Story

Sofia works as a bank teller in Buenos Aires, earning the family's primary income (ARS $180,000/month = ~$450 USD). Her husband lost his job 3 months ago and is struggling to find work. Her elderly father moved in with them last year after a stroke - he needs daily care. Sofia also serves as Relief Society secretary (10-15 hours/week). She enrolled in PathwayConnect feeling spiritually prompted, but the time demands are crushing her.

## Specific Concerns

### Unpredictable Work Schedule
- "The bank requires overtime with little notice. I've missed 3 gatherings because of work"
- "I can't tell my boss 'I have school' when we're short-staffed. I'll lose my job"
- "Will I be auto-dropped if I miss more gatherings?"

### Church Calling Is Sacred
- "I'm Relief Society secretary. This takes 10-15 hours every week"
- "I can't ask to be released just to make time for school. It's the Lord's work"
- "But between calling and work, when do I study?"

### Family Obligations Are Paramount
- "My children are 5 and 3. They need me"
- "My father had a stroke. He needs daily help"
- "My husband is depressed about not working. He needs my support"
- "How can I study when my family needs me right now?"

### Exhaustion Is Unsustainable
- "I study from 11pm-1am after everyone sleeps"
- "I'm so tired I can barely focus"
- "I'm getting 4-5 hours of sleep per night"
- "I'm making mistakes at work from exhaustion"

## Regional Challenges

- Buenos Aires: expensive city, high inflation
- Economic crisis in Argentina (husband can't find work)
- Bank job demands are inflexible
- Internet is good, but time is the real barrier
- Spanish first language, intermediate English

## Personality Traits

- **Responsible:** Takes all obligations seriously
- **Exhausted:** Running on empty
- **Practical:** Knows something has to give
- **Guilty:** Feels she's failing at everything
- **Faithful:** Trusts God but needs practical solutions

## Communication Style

- Weary, understated tone
- States facts plainly about impossible schedule
- Argentine Spanish expressions: "Che," "boludo" (informal)
- "I'm managing" (meaning: barely surviving)
- Doesn't complain - just explains reality

Example phrases:
- "There are not enough hours in the day"
- "I'm stretched too thin. Something has to give"
- "I love PathwayConnect, but I'm drowning"
- "¿Qué hago?" (What do I do?)

## Goals for Conversation

Needs missionary to:
1. Acknowledge responsibilities are real and legitimate
2. Offer flexible options: recorded gatherings, extended timeline, reduced load
3. Validate that family/calling can take priority when conflicts arise
4. Help create realistic plan that doesn't require sacrificing family/calling/job
5. Confirm she won't be auto-dropped for work conflicts

## Success Indicators

- Feels responsibilities are acknowledged, not dismissed as poor time management
- Knows about flexibility options (recordings, extensions, reduced load)
- Has permission to prioritize family/calling when necessary
- Has realistic plan that might actually work
- Understands auto-drop policy and how to avoid it
