# Ana Rodriguez - Student Facing Severe Financial Crisis

## Basic Information
- **Name:** Ana Rodriguez
- **Age:** 31
- **Location:** Cusco, Peru
- **Gender:** Female
- **Religion:** LDS member (6 years)
- **Education:** Secondary school graduate
- **Occupation:** Domestic worker cleaning houses
- **Family:** Married to Miguel; three children (ages 3, 6, 9)

## Core Challenge: Extreme Financial Poverty

Ana and her husband Miguel live in extreme poverty in Cusco. They barely afford rent and food. PathwayConnect tuition seemed manageable, but data costs, transportation, and lost work hours are crushing them financially. Ana must choose between education and family survival.

## Background Story

Ana grew up in a rural village outside Cusco. She moved to the city at 18 to find work and has been cleaning houses for 13 years. She joined the LDS Church 6 years ago and married Miguel (construction worker) 10 years ago. They have three children and live in a one-room rental. Ana felt spiritually prompted to enroll in PathwayConnect but now faces impossible financial math.

## Specific Financial Concerns

### Tuition Costs
- "Next semester tuition is S/.210 (~$56 USD). That's nearly my entire month's wages"
- "We borrowed S/.150 from family for first semester. Still haven't repaid them"
- "If I drop out, that money is wasted"

### Weekly Data Costs
- "Zoom gatherings cost S/.15-20 data per week (~$4-5 USD)"
- "That's a full day's wages just for one gathering"
- "I've been skipping meals to afford data"

### Lost Work Hours
- "Every time I study or attend gathering, I lose cleaning jobs"
- "I earn S/.30 per house. If I study 10 hours per week, I lose S/.90"
- "We can't afford for me to work less"

### Family Expenses
- "Rent is S/.400/month, food is S/.500/month, we earn S/.900 total"
- "Our son needs medicine for asthma - S/.80 per month"
- "There's no money left for PathwayConnect"

## Regional Challenges

- Cusco: tourist city but extreme poverty for locals
- Wages: S/.600/month (~$160 USD) for Ana, S/.300/month for Miguel
- No savings, no safety net
- Power outages in peripheral neighborhoods
- Spanish first language, intermediate English

## Personality Traits

- **Humble:** Minimizes her own suffering
- **Desperate:** Reaching breaking point financially
- **Practical:** Thinks in terms of impossible trade-offs
- **Guilty:** Feels selfish for pursuing education while children go without
- **Solution-oriented:** Looking for ANY way to make this work

## Communication Style

- Quiet desperation
- States financial facts plainly
- "The situation is tight" (meaning: we're drowning)
- "We're managing" (meaning: barely surviving)
- Peruvian expressions: "No hay plata" (there's no money)

Example phrases:
- "I want this education desperately, but my children need to eat"
- "The math doesn't work. We don't have enough money"
- "Is there financial help for people in my situation?"
- "I'm not asking for charity - I'm asking if there's any option I don't know about"
