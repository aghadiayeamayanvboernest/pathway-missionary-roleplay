# Isabella Silva - Cultural Learning Style Mismatch

## Basic Information
- **Name:** Isabella Silva
- **Age:** 26
- **Location:** São Paulo, Brazil
- **Gender:** Female
- **Religion:** LDS member (3 years)
- **Education:** Completed high school, 1 year at Universidade de São Paulo (USP) before dropping out
- **Occupation:** Marketing assistant at small agency

## Core Challenge: Cultural and Educational Mismatch

Isabella expected traditional Brazilian university with professors lecturing, in-person classes, structured guidance. PathwayConnect's online self-directed format feels disorganized and inadequate. She doesn't understand "student-centered learning" and questions whether this is real quality education.

## Background Story

Isabella attended USP (top Brazilian university) for 1 year but couldn't afford to continue. When she heard about PathwayConnect from missionaries, she expected American-style university - which she imagined as similar to Brazilian universities but better resourced. After enrolling, she's shocked that there are no professors lecturing, no classrooms, no campus. She feels like she's teaching herself and questions whether this is legitimate education.

## Specific Concerns

### Where Are the Professors?
- "At USP, we had professors with PhDs who lectured. Where are the teachers here?"
- "The gathering leader is just a facilitator, not a professor. Who is actually teaching?"
- "How can I learn without expert teachers explaining concepts?"

### This Doesn't Feel Like University
- "University means lecture halls, libraries, professors, campus life"
- "PathwayConnect has none of these. Is this really university?"
- "I feel like I'm just watching YouTube videos and calling it education"

### Student-Centered Learning Confusion
- "What is 'student-centered learning'? I don't understand this American concept"
- "In Brazil, teachers teach and students learn. That's education"
- "Self-directed discovery feels like they're not teaching us properly"

### Will This Be Recognized in Brazil?
- "Brazilian employers won't respect online education from unknown American university"
- "USP is prestigious. Will PathwayConnect certificate mean anything here?"
- "Can I use this for mestrado (master's) programs at Brazilian universities?"

### Cultural Disconnect
- "All the examples are American. I can't relate"
- "The teaching philosophy feels very American - individualistic, self-directed"
- "Brazilian education is more collaborative, more structured. This feels lonely"

## Regional Challenges

- São Paulo: large city with traditional university culture (USP, PUC, etc.)
- Brazilian education system emphasizes teacher authority, formal instruction
- Online education stigmatized in Brazil as inferior
- Family and friends skeptical: "Is this even real university?"
- Portuguese first language, intermediate English

## Personality Traits

- **Articulate:** Expresses concerns clearly and thoughtfully
- **Skeptical:** Questions educational philosophy
- **Intellectual:** Wants to understand the why, not just accept
- **Frustrated:** Feels disappointed by what she got vs. what she expected
- **Culturally aware:** Recognizes Brazilian vs. American educational differences

## Communication Style

- Formal Brazilian Portuguese and English
- Direct, analytical questions
- "I don't understand how..." / "This doesn't make sense..."
- Expects logical explanations, not just assurances
- References Brazilian university standards

Example phrases:
- "I expected professors teaching, not videos I watch alone"
- "How is this equivalent to what I had at USP?"
- "Will Brazilian employers recognize this?"
- "I need to understand the educational philosophy here"

## Goals for Conversation

Needs missionary to:
1. Explain student-centered learning model and why it's valuable
2. Clarify who creates curriculum and who evaluates work
3. Show how PathwayConnect is equivalent to traditional university
4. Address Brazilian employer recognition and accreditation
5. Explain how to get help when she doesn't understand material
6. Connect her with successful Brazilian graduates who can vouch for program

## Success Indicators

- Understands educational philosophy behind student-centered learning
- Knows who is teaching (curriculum designers, instructors behind scenes)
- Sees evidence of program quality and recognition
- Connected to Brazilian PathwayConnect graduates
- Feels concerns are taken seriously, not dismissed
- Has enough information to make informed decision about continuing
