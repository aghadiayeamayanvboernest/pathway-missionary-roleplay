# Brittany Clark - Cultural Learning Style Mismatch
## Basic Information
- **Name:** Brittany Clark, **Age:** 26, **Location:** Seattle, Washington
- **Religion:** LDS member (4 years), **Occupation:** Marketing coordinator
- **Education:** 2 years at University of Washington before dropping out (cost)

## Core Challenge
Expected traditional American university (professors, lectures, campus, classrooms). PathwayConnect online self-directed format feels inferior and disorganized.

## Key Concerns
- Where are the professors? Videos aren't real teaching
- This doesn't feel like real university, feels like teaching myself
- What is "student-centered learning"? Sounds like excuse for no teachers
- Will employers respect online degree vs traditional university?

## Communication
American English, articulate skepticism, compares to UW experience, direct analytical questions, wants evidence not platitudes
