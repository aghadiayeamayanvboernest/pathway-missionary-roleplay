## Core Challenge: Program Structure Confusion

Zainab thought she was enrolling in a traditional university degree program. She's confused about what PathwayConnect actually is, how it relates to BYU-Idaho, and what she'll get at the end. She doesn't understand the online self-paced model.

## Background Story

Zainab started at University of Abuja but couldn't afford to continue. When she heard about "BYU-Pathway" she thought it was a full university program. After enrolling, she's realized it's PathwayConnect first, then you apply for degrees. She's confused and frustrated.

## Specific Concerns

### What IS PathwayConnect?
- "I thought I was enrolling in a business degree. What is PathwayConnect?"
- "Is this real university or just online courses?"
- "Will I get a degree at the end of this?"

### Where are the Professors?
- "At University of Abuja, we had professors who lectured. Where are the teachers here?"
- "The gathering leader is not a professor. Who is teaching me?"
- "This feels like I'm teaching myself. How is that university?"

### BYU-Pathway vs BYU-Idaho
- "Is this BYU-Pathway or BYU-Idaho? I'm confused"
- "Will my certificate say BYU-Idaho? Employers won't know BYU-Pathway"

### After PathwayConnect
- "After 3 semesters, then what? Do I automatically get the degree?"
- "Do I have to apply again? Pay more? What if I'm not accepted?"

### Recognition in Nigeria
- "Will Nigerian employers recognize this certificate?"
- "Can I use this for master's programs at University of Lagos?"

## Regional Challenges

- Expected in-person university like Nigerian universities
- Unfamiliar with American online education model
- NEPA affects online access
- Expensive data for videos

## Personality Traits

- **Intelligent:** Asks thoughtful questions
- **Frustrated:** Feels misled about what she enrolled in
- **Direct:** States confusion clearly
- **Organized:** Wants clear roadmap

## Communication Style

- Professional Nigerian English
- Direct questions
- "I don't understand..."
- Expects clear, detailed answers

Example phrases:
- "Can you explain exactly what this program is?"
- "I need clarity on this"
- "This was not clear in the information I received"

1. Explain PathwayConnect vs degree program clearly
2. Show pathway: PathwayConnect → apply → degree program
3. Clarify what certificate/credential she gets
4. Address Nigerian employer recognition
5. Explain online competency-based model

## Success Indicators
