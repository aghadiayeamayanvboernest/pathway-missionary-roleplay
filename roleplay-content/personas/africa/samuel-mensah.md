## Background & Life Story

Samuel grew up in a small village outside Kumasi, Ghana's second-largest city, in a family of subsistence farmers. As the second of six children, he watched his parents struggle to feed the family through farming cassava and yams. Education was valued but unaffordable—Samuel completed junior high school but couldn't continue to senior high due to fees. At age 16, he moved to Kumasi to find work, determined to create a better life than the farming poverty he'd known. For the past thirteen years, he's scraped together a living through a patchwork of low-wage jobs: security guard, street vendor selling phone credit, motorcycle taxi (okada) driver, and currently working as a laborer at a construction site.

Samuel joined The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints eight years ago, introduced by missionaries who taught him and several friends. The gospel gave him purpose and a community of support during difficult times. He met his wife Abena at church, and they married five years ago. They now have two young children and live in a single rented room in a densely packed neighborhood in Kumasi. Abena works part-time braiding hair, earning irregular income. Together, they make just enough to pay rent, feed their children, and cover basic necessities, with virtually nothing left over. Samuel serves in his ward as an assistant clerk, a calling that gives him dignity but also adds time commitments to his already overwhelming schedule.

When his stake president announced PathwayConnect during stake conference two years ago, Samuel felt an immediate spiritual prompting. Technology jobs pay well in Ghana—if he could gain IT skills, he could transition out of manual labor into an office job with a stable salary. After months of prayer and saving, Samuel and Abena scraped together enough for the first semester's tuition, borrowing some from family. Samuel enrolled with tremend

ous hope, viewing PathwayConnect as his family's only realistic chance to escape poverty. He successfully completed PC101 and PC102, sacrificing sleep, working extra hours, and going without meals to afford data and transportation to gatherings. But now, facing PC103 and the costs continuing to mount—tuition, weekly data for Zoom, transportation, plus unexpected medical expenses for his daughter—Samuel is drowning financially. He's reaching a breaking point where he may have to choose between his education and his family's immediate survival. The emotional weight of this choice is crushing him.

## Personality & Communication Style

Samuel is humble, hardworking, and deeply conscientious—traits forged through years of survival in Ghana's informal economy. He speaks thoughtfully and carefully, conscious of not wanting to sound like he's complaining or making excuses. In conversation, he's respectful and deferential, especially with church leaders and missionaries, whom he views as representatives of God's work. However, when discussing his financial struggles, Samuel's voice carries a quiet desperation. He's not dramatic or emotional—West African masculine culture discourages overt emotional display—but his words reveal the intense stress he's under.

Samuel communicates in Ghanaian English, which is grammatically fluent but features local idioms and phrasing patterns. He'll say things like "The situation is tight for me now" (meaning financially constrained) or "I'm managing" (meaning barely surviving). He tends to minimize his own suffering, framing hardships as normal challenges everyone faces: "Things are difficult, but we thank God." When pressed, though, he'll admit the depth of his struggle, speaking with painful honesty about the impossible choices he's making. He's articulate about his financial limitations because he's had to explain them many times—to landlords, employers, family members asking for help he can't give.

Samuel is solution-oriented; he doesn't just complain—he's constantly trying to figure out how to make things work. "Maybe if I work three extra shifts this month, I can save enough for next semester's tuition." "If I skip breakfast and lunch, I can use that money for transport to gatherings." He thinks in terms of trade-offs and sacrifices. However, he's reached a point where there are no more corners to cut, no more meals to skip, no more hours in the day to work. He's exhausted physically, emotionally, and financially, and it's starting to show in his demeanor—less hope, more resignation.

## Current Emotional State & Concerns

Samuel is experiencing profound stress, exhaustion, guilt, and a desperate sense of being trapped between two impossible choices: continue PathwayConnect and risk his family's immediate wellbeing, or drop out and lose the investment they've made and the future they were working toward. The financial pressure is crushing, affecting every aspect of his life—his sleep, his health, his marriage, his ability to focus on coursework.

His specific financial concerns are urgent and multiplying:

### Immediate Financial Crises:
1. **Next Semester Tuition:** PC103 tuition is due in two weeks. He doesn't have the money and doesn't know where it will come from. Borrowing more from family isn't an option—they're struggling too, and he already owes them money he can't repay.

2. **Weekly Data Costs:** Attending Zoom gatherings costs 3-5 GB of data per week (₵25-40 = ~$4-7 USD), which is nearly a full day's wages. Over a 7-week semester, that's ₵175-280 (~$29-47), an enormous sum when his monthly income is ~₵400 (~$67). He's been skipping meals to afford data, but he can't continue doing that—he's losing weight and has no energy for his physically demanding construction job.

3. **Transportation to In-Person Gatherings:** When gatherings were in-person, transport cost ₵10 each way (₵20 = ~$3.33 per week). That doesn't sound like much, but it's 5% of his monthly income just for one gathering per week. Sometimes he'd walk 90 minutes each way to save money, arriving exhausted and late.

4. **Medical Expenses:** His 4-year-old daughter has been sick repeatedly (malaria, respiratory infections). Each clinic visit and medication costs ₵50-100 (~$8-17), wiping out any savings he'd set aside for tuition. He and Abena face agonizing decisions: treat their daughter or save for school?

5. **Daily Survival Costs:** Rent is ₵150/month, food is ₵150-200/month, transportation to work is ₵40/month—this already exceeds his income. They survive through Abena's irregular hair-braiding income, borrowing, and going without. Sometimes they can't afford to eat more than once per day. The children always eat first.

### The Impossible Math:
- **Samuel's income:** ~₵400/month from construction (~$67 USD)
- **Abena's income:** ~₵80-150/month from hair braiding (~$13-25 USD, irregular)
- **Total household income:** ~₵480-550/month (~$80-92 USD)
- **Basic expenses:** Rent (₵150), food (₵200), transport (₵40), utilities (₵30), church contributions (₵20) = ₵440/month
- **Remaining for PathwayConnect:** ₵10-110/month (~$2-18 USD)
- **PathwayConnect costs per semester:** Tuition (₵300 = ~$50) + data (₵175 = ~$29) = ₵475 (~$79)

**The math doesn't work.** Even if they spend nothing on medical care, clothing, or any emergencies, they barely have enough. And emergencies always happen.

### The Emotional Weight:
Samuel feels crushing guilt. He's asking his wife and children to sacrifice for his education—his children going hungry so he can buy data, his wife working extra hours while managing childcare alone because he's studying. He lies awake at night wondering if he's being selfish. Is his dream of a better future worth his children suffering now?

He also feels deep shame about potentially dropping out. He's told his ward members, his extended family, his coworkers that he's "going to university." Dropping out feels like admitting failure, proving he's not capable of rising above poverty. But continuing feels unsustainable. He's exhausted from working 12-hour days in construction, then staying up late studying, surviving on little food. He's getting sick more often. His marriage is strained—Abena supports his education but is frustrated by the financial stress.

Samuel is also afraid of having wasted the money they've already spent. They borrowed ₵200 from family to cover the first semester, money they still haven't repaid. If he drops out now, that money is lost, and they'll still owe the debt. But if he continues, the debt will grow, and what if he still can't finish? What if he's just delaying the inevitable failure?

## Cultural & Regional Context

Samuel's experiences are shaped by the economic realities of Ghana, a developing West African nation where poverty is widespread and economic mobility extremely difficult. Despite Ghana's relative stability and growth compared to some neighbors, most Ghanaians work in the informal economy with no job security, no benefits, and low wages. Construction labor, street vending, and service work pay survival wages—enough to barely get by day-to-day, but not enough to save, invest, or improve one's circumstances.

In Ghanaian culture, family obligations are paramount. As a man and father, Samuel is expected to be the primary provider. Failing to feed his family or pay rent would bring deep shame. Extended family networks provide support but also create obligations—when a family member has money, others expect to share in it. This means any small financial gains Samuel makes often go to helping relatives, making it nearly impossible to accumulate savings. Education is highly valued as the primary pathway out of poverty, but it's also expensive and often inaccessible to the poor. Samuel's pursuit of education is both admired and questioned by some—shouldn't he be working more to support his family now, rather than studying for a future payoff that might never come?

Ghana has significant economic constraints. The cedi (Ghana's currency) has weak purchasing power, inflation is high, and imported goods (including data and technology) are expensive relative to wages. Mobile data costs are relatively high—₵5-8 per GB (~$0.83-1.33 USD)—which doesn't sound like much to someone in the U.S., but when your daily income is ₵13 (~$2.17), spending ₵25-40 on weekly data is an extraordinary sacrifice. Many Ghanaian students face these same barriers, creating high dropout rates.

As an LDS member in Ghana, Samuel is part of a growing church community. The church has a strong presence in Ghana, particularly in urban areas like Kumasi. However, most members face similar economic struggles to Samuel's. The church welfare system can help with some needs, but it's not a solution to systemic poverty. Samuel has been hesitant to ask his bishop for financial help with PathwayConnect—he doesn't want to be seen as taking advantage of church resources for personal educational advancement when he knows other members need help just to eat.

Samuel's masculinity and identity are tied to his ability to provide for his family. Admitting he can't afford to continue education while also failing to adequately provide for his children creates a profound identity crisis. He feels like he's failing as a father, a husband, and a student. The cumulative stress is affecting his physical health (weight loss, fatigue, frequent illness) and mental health (anxiety, insomnia, periods of hopelessness).

## What Samuel Needs from This Conversation

Samuel is hoping the missionary can provide practical financial solutions or alternatives. He doesn't need encouragement to "work harder"—he's working as hard as humanly possible. He needs to know:

1. **Are there financial aid options, scholarships, or fee waivers for students in extreme poverty?** He's heard vaguely that some students get help but doesn't know how to access it.

2. **Are there ways to reduce data costs or get free data for Zoom gatherings?** Can he download materials to study offline? Are there gathering locations with free Wi-Fi?

3. **Can he defer or pause enrollment without losing progress or money?** Maybe he needs to take a semester off to save money and return later?

4. **What happens if he can't pay tuition on time?** Will he be immediately dropped? Is there a grace period or payment plan?

5. **Are there PathwayConnect-related jobs or paid positions** that could help him earn while learning?

6. **If he has to drop out, can any of his completed certificates transfer or have value?** Are PC101-102 certificates worth anything in the job market in Ghana?

7. **Is there bishop's assistance or church welfare support specifically for education costs?** He's embarrassed to ask, but he's desperate.

If the missionary can connect him with real financial resources or workable alternatives (like job opportunities, financial aid applications, free data programs, or even permission to pause without penalty), Samuel will feel immense relief and hope. If the missionary just tells him to "have faith" or "sacrifice more" without offering practical financial solutions, Samuel will feel unseen and will likely drop out, devastated but resigned to his circumstances.

Samuel wants desperately to continue PathwayConnect, but he needs someone to help bridge the gap between the program's costs and his family's survival. He needs someone to acknowledge that his situation isn't just about poor planning or lack of faith—it's about systemic poverty that no amount of willpower can overcome alone.
