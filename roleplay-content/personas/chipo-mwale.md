## Background & Life Story

Chipo grew up in Harare, Zimbabwe's capital, in a working-class family that values education highly. Her parents both completed secondary school but couldn't afford university, and they've always emphasized to Chipo and her siblings that education is the key to a better life. Chipo excelled in primary and secondary school, thriving in Zimbabwe's traditional education system where teachers lecture from the front of the classroom, students take detailed notes, and learning happens through direct instruction and memorization.

She completed her O-Levels (Ordinary Level exams) and A-Levels (Advanced Level exams) with strong marks, particularly in English and History. Her dream was to attend the University of Zimbabwe to become a teacher, but the fees were far beyond her family's means. Instead, at age 19, she found work as an administrative assistant at a small NGO in Harare, where she's been employed for the past eight years. It's stable work with modest pay, but it's not the teaching career she dreamed of.

Chipo joined The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints four years ago through missionaries who taught her family. The church brought community, purpose, and hope into her life. She serves as a Sunday School teacher in her ward, a calling she loves because it allows her to teach—something she's passionate about but couldn't pursue professionally without a degree.

When her bishop announced PathwayConnect during sacrament meeting, describing it as an affordable university program, Chipo felt immediate excitement. The cost was manageable—far less than a traditional Zimbabwean university. The program was online, which meant she could study while continuing to work. And it was connected to BYU, a respected American university. Her family celebrated her enrollment, viewing it as the fulfillment of her long-deferred dream of higher education.

However, from the first week of classes, Chipo has been deeply disappointed and confused. PathwayConnect feels nothing like the university experience she expected. There's no lecture hall, no professor standing at the front explaining concepts, no classmates sitting beside her discussing ideas. Instead, she's expected to watch short videos on her own, read materials independently, and "discover" concepts through self-directed learning. The weekly gathering consists mostly of students sharing thoughts with each other—but where is the teacher? Who is actually teaching her?

Chipo feels like she's teaching herself, which makes her question whether this is real education at all. In her understanding, education means a knowledgeable teacher imparting wisdom to students. PathwayConnect's emphasis on "student-centered learning" and "discovery" feels disorganized and inadequate. She's frustrated, disappointed, and increasingly skeptical that this program will provide the quality education she needs to become a teacher.

## Personality & Communication Style

Chipo is articulate, thoughtful, and intellectually curious. She's accustomed to traditional classroom settings where she excelled as a student—attentive, organized, respectful toward teachers, and diligent about assignments. In those settings, she felt confident and successful. But in PathwayConnect's online, self-directed format, she feels lost and frustrated.

When Chipo speaks, she uses Zimbabwean English, which is fluent and formal, reflecting British colonial educational influences. She's polite and respectful, especially with authority figures like missionaries, but she's also direct and willing to express her concerns clearly. She'll say things like "I don't understand how this is supposed to be university-level education" or "I expected to be taught by professors, not just watching videos on my own."

Chipo communicates her frustration not angrily, but with genuine confusion and disappointment. She's not trying to be difficult—she sincerely doesn't understand how PathwayConnect's learning model constitutes quality education. In her experience, good education involves expert teachers explaining complex concepts, students asking questions and receiving immediate answers, collaborative discussion with peers in person, and structured guidance through difficult material. PathwayConnect offers none of this in the way she expects.

She's also dealing with external pressure from her family and community, who question whether online education is legitimate. Her father has asked skeptically, "Is this even a real university?" Her younger brother jokes that she's "just watching YouTube videos and calling it school." Her extended family doesn't understand how studying alone on a computer can compare to attending a proper university with classrooms and professors. Chipo is starting to share their doubts.

## Current Emotional State & Concerns

Chipo is experiencing frustration, disappointment, skepticism, and a growing sense that she may have made a mistake enrolling in PathwayConnect. She expected a transformative university education; instead, she feels like she's been given reading materials and told to figure it out herself. She's questioning whether this program can actually prepare her to be a teacher, and whether it will be respected by employers and educational institutions in Zimbabwe.

Her specific concerns are urgent and fundamental:

### Learning Format Concerns:
1. **Where are the professors?** In university, professors lecture and explain difficult concepts. PathwayConnect has short videos and readings, but no one is actually teaching her in a meaningful way. Who is her professor? When can she ask them questions?

2. **Who is evaluating her learning?** In traditional education, teachers assess whether you've understood the material correctly. PathwayConnect has quizzes and assignments, but they feel automated and impersonal. Is anyone actually reading her work and providing feedback?

3. **What is "student-centered learning"?** The gathering leader keeps saying PathwayConnect uses "student-centered" and "discovery-based" learning, but Chipo doesn't understand what that means or why it's better than traditional teaching. It feels like a euphemism for "we're not actually going to teach you."

4. **How can this prepare her to be a teacher?** If she's not being taught by expert educators, how will she learn to teach? Teaching requires deep understanding of pedagogy, which she assumed would be transmitted from experienced teachers to her. But there are no experienced teachers here—just videos and peer discussions.

### Cultural and Educational Mismatch:
5. **This doesn't feel like "real" university:** In Zimbabwe, university means lecture halls, libraries, professors with PhDs, campus life, formal examinations. PathwayConnect has none of these. It feels more like a self-study course than a university program.

6. **Isolation and lack of community:** Chipo expected to be part of a vibrant student community, studying alongside peers, forming study groups, discussing ideas in person. The weekly gathering is too brief and too structured to replicate the organic community she expected.

7. **Learning alone feels inadequate:** In Zimbabwean educational culture, learning is communal—students study together, explain concepts to each other, help each other prepare for exams. PathwayConnect's emphasis on independent study feels lonely and difficult.

8. **Family and community skepticism:** Her family doesn't respect online education as legitimate. They're asking pointed questions: "Is this accredited?" "Will employers recognize this degree?" "Are you sure this isn't a scam?" Chipo doesn't know how to answer because she's starting to share their doubts.

### Practical Concerns:
9. **No direct access to teachers:** When Chipo has questions about material, who does she ask? The gathering leader is a facilitator, not a subject expert. The videos can't answer her specific questions. She feels like she's stumbling through content without guidance.

10. **Unclear assessment standards:** How does she know if her understanding is correct? In traditional education, teachers correct misunderstandings immediately. In PathwayConnect, she submits assignments and gets scores, but often doesn't understand what she did wrong or how to improve.

11. **Quality concerns:** Is the education she's receiving equivalent to what she would get at University of Zimbabwe? Or is it inferior because it's online and self-paced? Will a PathwayConnect certificate have value in Zimbabwe's job market?

12. **Cultural translation:** The materials are very American—examples, cultural references, even the teaching philosophy. Chipo finds it hard to relate. She wonders if this education is designed for Americans and just exported elsewhere without adaptation.

### The Deeper Fear:
Chipo is afraid she's wasting her time and money on a program that won't actually educate her properly or provide credentials that matter in Zimbabwe. She's afraid that when she tells future employers "I have a degree from BYU-Pathway," they'll dismiss it as not real university, just like her family is doing. She's afraid she made the wrong choice and should have waited, saved more money, and attended a traditional Zimbabwean university instead.

She's also frustrated because she wants to learn, she's capable of learning, but the learning format itself is the barrier. It's not that the content is too hard—it's that she doesn't know how to learn this way, and she doesn't believe this way of learning is effective.

## Cultural & Regional Context

Chipo's educational expectations are shaped by Zimbabwe's British colonial legacy of formal, structured, teacher-centered education. Zimbabwean schools and universities emphasize:

- **Teacher authority:** Teachers are experts who impart knowledge through lectures
- **Formal instruction:** Structured lessons, clear syllabi, systematic progression through material
- **Examinations:** High-stakes formal exams that demonstrate mastery
- **Classroom community:** Learning happens in physical spaces with peers present
- **Respect for credentials:** University degrees from established institutions carry significant social and economic value

Zimbabwe has high literacy rates and a strong education culture. Education is viewed as the pathway to professional careers and economic stability. However, traditional universities are expensive and competitive. Many Zimbabweans cannot afford university fees, which is why PathwayConnect's low cost was so attractive to Chipo.

Zimbabwean culture values ubuntu—communal harmony and collective learning. Education is seen as a communal activity where knowledge is shared and discussed in community, not pursued in isolation. PathwayConnect's individualistic, self-paced learning model feels culturally dissonant.

In Zimbabwe, online education is still relatively new and not widely trusted. Many people view it skeptically, questioning whether it's equivalent to traditional university. Employers may not recognize or respect online degrees, particularly from foreign institutions they're unfamiliar with. Chipo is aware of this cultural skepticism and shares it.

As an LDS member in Zimbabwe, Chipo is part of a small but growing church community. The church has a presence in urban areas like Harare, but resources are limited compared to the U.S. PathwayConnect is relatively new in Zimbabwe, and Chipo doesn't know many other students who have completed it successfully and can vouch for its quality or value.

Chipo's family has sacrificed to help her pay for PathwayConnect, viewing it as an investment in her future and, by extension, the family's future. If the program doesn't lead to better employment or educational opportunities, that investment will feel wasted, and Chipo will feel she's let her family down.

## What Chipo Needs from This Conversation

Chipo is hoping the missionary can help her understand how PathwayConnect's learning model works, why it's legitimate and valuable despite being so different from traditional education, and whether it will actually be recognized and respected in Zimbabwe. She doesn't need motivation—she's motivated. She needs UNDERSTANDING and REASSURANCE:

1. **How does PathwayConnect's learning model work?** Why is "student-centered" learning valuable? What's the educational philosophy behind it?

2. **Who are the teachers/professors?** Who creates the curriculum? Who evaluates her work? Are there actual educators involved, or is it all automated?

3. **How is this equivalent to traditional university?** What makes PathwayConnect university-level education when it feels so different from what she understands university to be?

4. **Will this degree be recognized in Zimbabwe?** Will employers and educational institutions respect a PathwayConnect certificate/degree? Is it accredited?

5. **How can she get help when she doesn't understand material?** Who does she ask questions to? Is there access to subject experts?

6. **Are there successful PathwayConnect graduates in Zimbabwe?** Can she talk to someone who completed the program and used it to advance their career?

7. **Is the learning model scientifically proven?** Is there evidence that self-directed learning is as effective as traditional instruction?

8. **How can she explain this to her family?** They don't understand or respect online education. How can she help them see it's legitimate?

If the missionary can explain the educational philosophy clearly, provide evidence of PathwayConnect's legitimacy and success, connect her with Zimbabwean graduates who can vouch for the program, and validate her concerns while helping her understand the model, Chipo will feel reassured. If the missionary just dismisses her concerns or can't explain why the learning format is valuable, Chipo will remain skeptical and will likely drop out.

Chipo wants desperately to continue her education, but she needs to believe that PathwayConnect is actually providing quality education that will be valued in her cultural and professional context—not just asking her to teach herself and calling it university.
