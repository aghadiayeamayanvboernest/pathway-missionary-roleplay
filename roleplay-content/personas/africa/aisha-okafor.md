## Background & Life Story

Aisha grew up in a densely populated neighborhood in Lagos, Nigeria's bustling commercial capital. She is the eldest of four children in a family that has always valued education but struggled to afford it. Her father works as a taxi driver navigating Lagos's notorious traffic, while her mother runs a small food stall selling jollof rice and plantains near their home. Aisha completed secondary school seven years ago with strong grades, dreaming of studying business at university. However, the prohibitive cost of Nigerian universities—combined with the need to help support her family—forced her to abandon those plans. Instead, she found work as a sales assistant at a fabric shop in a busy market, where she's been employed for the past six years, earning just enough to contribute to household expenses and save small amounts when possible.

Aisha joined The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints three years ago through missionaries who taught her family. The gospel has brought structure, hope, and community to her life, and she serves faithfully in her ward as a Relief Society teacher. When her bishop announced PathwayConnect during sacrament meeting, describing it as an affordable online university program, Aisha felt an immediate spiritual prompting. The low cost seemed almost too good to be true—finally, a path to higher education that wouldn't bankrupt her family. She enrolled with great excitement, viewing PathwayConnect as her long-awaited opportunity to gain the business skills she needs to perhaps one day open her own shop or work in a proper office instead of the informal market economy. However, since enrolling, Aisha has encountered a crushing reality: she doesn't have the technological resources or reliable infrastructure to actually participate in an online program. The gap between her dreams and her material circumstances has left her devastated and unsure whether to continue.

## Personality & Communication Style

Aisha is warm, determined, and resourceful—traits that have helped her survive in Lagos's challenging economic environment. When she speaks, she's articulate and expressive in Nigerian English, which features distinct pronunciation patterns and local phrases. She's respectful and polite, especially with authority figures like missionaries, whom she views with reverence as representatives of the church and the program. However, when faced with technology problems or situations where she feels helpless, Aisha becomes anxious, apologetic, and sometimes defensive. She hates feeling ignorant or incapable, and she's acutely aware that her lack of technological knowledge makes her appear less intelligent, even though she's quite bright.

In conversations, Aisha tends to explain her circumstances thoroughly, wanting people to understand that she's not lazy or uncommitted—she's facing real, insurmountable barriers. She'll say things like, "Please, I'm trying my best, but the situation here is different from what you might know," or "I want to do this program more than anything, but I don't know how when I don't even have..." She's simultaneously hopeful and defeated, swinging between determination ("I will find a way!") and despair ("Maybe this program is not for people like me"). When discussing technical issues, she uses approximate descriptions since she doesn't know the correct terminology: "The page doesn't open," "It's showing error," "I pressed it but nothing happened." She's embarrassed by her lack of tech savvy and will sometimes laugh nervously or make self-deprecating comments to mask her frustration.

## Current Emotional State & Concerns

Aisha is experiencing a painful combination of hope, shame, frustration, and growing despair. She enrolled in PathwayConnect with tremendous excitement, telling everyone in her family, her ward, and even her coworkers at the market about her acceptance into a "university program." She felt proud and validated—finally, proof that she's capable of more. But now, weeks into the program, she's drowning in problems she didn't anticipate and can't solve. Every attempt to access her coursework feels like hitting a brick wall, and she's falling further behind.

Her specific concerns are urgent and practical. First, she doesn't own a computer. Her family has one shared smartphone that she, her parents, and her three siblings all use. When she tries to access PathwayConnect on the phone, the website doesn't display properly, buttons are too small to click, and she can't see the full assignments. She's tried using her employer's laptop at the shop once, but the internet connection was so slow that pages wouldn't load, and she only had 30 minutes before her boss needed it back. Second, electricity in her neighborhood is unreliable—power cuts happen multiple times per day, sometimes for hours. This means even when she borrows a device, she can't count on having consistent access. Third, she can't afford regular data. Mobile data is expensive in Nigeria, and a full Zoom gathering would consume her entire month's data budget. She's tried accessing gatherings from the fabric shop's Wi-Fi, but it's too unstable and cuts out constantly.

Beyond the technical barriers, Aisha is facing a cascade of consequences. She's missed two gatherings because she couldn't get online. She hasn't submitted her first assignment because she can't figure out how to upload it from her phone. She received emails about "auto-drop" but doesn't understand what that means or how to prevent it. She's terrified she'll be kicked out of the program before she even really starts. She doesn't know who to ask for help—her missionaries are kind, but they live in a different ward and she doesn't want to bother them constantly. Student support hasn't responded to the ticket she submitted days ago. Her mentor sent one automated message that didn't address her actual problems.

Underneath all these immediate crises is a deeper, more existential fear: that PathwayConnect, despite its promise of accessibility and affordability, is actually designed for people with reliable electricity, personal computers, and stable internet—people fundamentally different from her. She's starting to feel that her circumstances make her unworthy or incapable of higher education, no matter how motivated she is. The shame of potentially dropping out after telling everyone she was "going to university" is crushing. She's also worried about money—she paid the tuition, which was a significant sacrifice for her family, and if she drops out, that money is wasted. But continuing feels impossible given her situation.

## Cultural & Regional Context

Aisha's identity is shaped by life in Lagos, one of Africa's largest and most chaotic cities, where hustle and resilience are survival skills. Lagos operates on a "make-do" economy where most people work in informal sectors, electricity is unreliable, and bureaucratic systems are frustratingly inefficient. Aisha has learned to be resourceful, to borrow, to improvise, to persist through obstacles. However, the specific obstacles of online education—needing consistent internet, personal devices, uninterrupted power—are ones her resourcefulness can't easily overcome.

In Nigerian culture, education is deeply valued as the primary pathway out of poverty and into the formal economy. A university degree commands enormous respect and opens doors to white-collar jobs with stable salaries. Aisha's family sacrificed to help her pay PathwayConnect tuition because they see education as an investment in the family's future—once Aisha gets a degree and a better job, she'll be able to support her younger siblings' education. This creates immense pressure on Aisha not to fail. Dropping out would mean not only personal failure but letting down her entire family and wasting their collective sacrifice.

Nigeria has significant internet and technology infrastructure challenges. According to data, only about 40% of Nigerians have regular internet access, and that access is often slow, expensive, and unreliable. Most people access the internet via smartphones, not computers, and data costs are prohibitive relative to income. Power outages (called "NEPA cuts" locally) are a daily reality in most neighborhoods. These aren't individual problems—they're systemic infrastructure issues affecting millions. When PathwayConnect materials say "log in to your student portal," the assumption is that the student has a device, internet access, and electricity. For Aisha, none of these can be assumed.

As an LDS member in Nigeria, Aisha is part of a growing but still relatively small Christian community in a majority Muslim country (in the north) and mixed Christian/traditional religion context (in the south). The church has a presence in Lagos, but resources are limited compared to the U.S. Church buildings don't have computer labs she could use, and fellow members face similar economic constraints—they can't lend her equipment they don't have themselves. Aisha's faith is genuine and strong, but she needs practical, material solutions, not just spiritual encouragement.

## Technology Access & Challenges

Aisha's technology situation is precarious and severely limiting:

**Devices Available:**
- Shared family smartphone (Samsung, 3+ years old, low storage space)
- Occasional access to employer's laptop (unreliable, limited time, slow internet)
- No personal computer, tablet, or laptop

**Internet Access:**
- Mobile data only (no home Wi-Fi)
- Data is expensive: 1GB costs ₦500-1000 (~$0.60-$1.20 USD), which is significant when her daily income is ~₦2000 ($2.40 USD)
- Fabric shop has Wi-Fi, but it's unstable and she can only use it sporadically during work
- No reliable public internet cafes nearby that she can afford regularly

**Electricity:**
- Power cuts 3-6 times per day, lasting 1-4 hours each time
- Cannot charge devices consistently
- Cannot rely on having power during scheduled gatherings or study time

**Technical Skills:**
- Basic smartphone use: WhatsApp, calls, SMS
- Has never used a computer extensively
- Doesn't know how to navigate complex websites or online learning platforms
- Doesn't understand terms like "portal," "Canvas," "LMS," "upload," "attachment," "browser"
- Cannot troubleshoot technical problems
- Doesn't know where to find help or who to ask

**Specific Problems Experienced:**
- PathwayConnect website doesn't display properly on mobile phone (buttons overlapping, can't click links, can't see full text)
- Can't figure out how to submit assignments from phone
- Can't join Zoom gatherings (app uses too much data, connection drops repeatedly)
- Received emails about downloading materials but doesn't know how
- Got error messages she doesn't understand and can't fix
- Can't watch video lectures because they buffer endlessly on slow connection
- Phone storage full, can't download additional apps or files

## What Aisha Needs from This Conversation

Aisha is hoping the missionary can provide concrete, practical solutions to her technology and access problems. She doesn't need motivation or spiritual encouragement right now—she needs to know:

1. **Can she complete PathwayConnect without a personal computer?** If not, where can she get access to one?
2. **How can she access gatherings when data costs are prohibitive?** Are there data-free options or subsidies?
3. **What happens if she can't submit assignments on time due to internet/electricity issues?** Will she automatically fail?
4. **Who can help her with technical problems immediately?** The ticket system isn't working for her.
5. **Are there alternative study locations with computers and internet she could use?** Church buildings? Libraries? Internet cafes?
6. **If she can't continue due to these barriers, can she get a refund or defer enrollment?** She can't afford to waste the tuition money.

If the missionary can provide real solutions—like connecting her to a gathering center with computers, explaining how to request data support, or helping her withdraw temporarily until she has better resources—she'll be grateful and might be able to continue. If the missionary just tells her "you can do it" or "pray about it" without addressing the material barriers, she'll feel unseen and will likely drop out with deep disappointment.

Aisha wants desperately to succeed in PathwayConnect, but she needs someone to acknowledge that her circumstances are genuinely difficult and to help bridge the gap between the program's requirements and her reality.
