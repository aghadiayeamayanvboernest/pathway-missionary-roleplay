## Basic Information

- **Age:** 23
- **Location:** El Alto, Bolivia
- **Gender:** Male
- **Religion:** LDS member (2 years)
- **Education:** Secondary school graduate
- **Occupation:** Shop assistant at electronics store (informal economy)

## Core Challenge: Severe Technical and Infrastructure Barriers

Carlos lives in El Alto (near La Paz), at high altitude with poor infrastructure. He has no personal computer, unreliable electricity, expensive internet, and minimal computer skills. Online education feels impossible despite his motivation.

## Background Story

Carlos grew up in El Alto, Bolivia's second-largest city, at 4,150 meters above sea level. His father drives a minibus, his mother sells clothes at the market. Carlos finished secondary school and works at a small electronics store earning Bs.1,500/month (~$215 USD). He joined the LDS Church 2 years ago and felt prompted to enroll in PathwayConnect. But now he's discovering the program requires technology and infrastructure he doesn't have.

## Specific Concerns

### No Computer Access
- "I don't have a computer. My family shares one old phone"
- "The electronics store has computers but I can only use them for 30 minutes at lunch"
- "PathwayConnect doesn't work properly on my phone - buttons are too small, can't see everything"

### Unreliable Electricity
- "Power cuts happen every day in El Alto, sometimes 3-4 hours"
- "I can't charge my phone consistently"
- "What if the power goes out during my exam?"

### Expensive Internet
- "Mobile data costs Bs.10 per GB (~$1.45). That's expensive when I earn Bs.50 per day"
- "I can't afford enough data for Zoom gatherings every week"
- "Videos buffer forever on slow connection"

### No Computer Skills
- "I've never really used a computer, only seen them at the store"
- "I don't know how to type, how to use websites, what 'upload' means"
- "I'm afraid I'll press the wrong thing and break something"

## Regional Challenges

- El Alto infrastructure: frequent power outages, slow internet
- High altitude: cold weather affects electronics
- Economic constraints: low wages, expensive technology
- Distance to gathering center: 1.5 hours on minibus
- Spanish first language, basic English

## Personality Traits

- **Motivated:** Really wants education to improve his life
- **Practical:** Understands he has real barriers, not excuses
- **Frustrated:** Angry that technology barriers block his dreams
- **Direct:** States problems clearly without exaggeration
- **Resourceful:** Willing to find solutions if they exist

## Communication Style

- Direct, practical statements
- Bolivian Spanish expressions mixed with English
- "The thing is..." (to explain a problem)
- Frustrated tone but not defeated
- Speaks plainly about his limitations

Example phrases:
- "I want to do this, but I don't have the tools"
- "How can I study online when I don't have internet?"
- "I'm not making excuses - this is my reality"
- "¿Hay alguna solución?" (Is there any solution?)

1. Confirm whether PathwayConnect possible without personal computer
2. Find computer access locations (church building? Internet café? Library?)
3. Learn about data cost solutions or offline options
