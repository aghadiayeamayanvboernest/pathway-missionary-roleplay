- **Location:** Bogotá, Colombia
- **Gender:** Female
- **Religion:** LDS member (lifelong)
- **Education:** 2 years at Universidad Nacional de Colombia (didn't complete due to costs)

## Core Challenge: Program Structure Confusion

Daniela thought she was enrolling in a full university degree program. She's confused about what PathwayConnect actually is, how it relates to BYU-Idaho, what she'll get at the end, and how the online competency-based model works. She doesn't understand the pathway from PC to degree programs.

## Background Story

Daniela started at Universidad Nacional in Bogotá but couldn't afford to continue after 2 years. When she heard about "BYU-Pathway" from missionaries, she thought it was a complete university program. After enrolling in PathwayConnect, she realized it's a 3-semester certificate program FIRST, then you apply for degree programs. She's confused and frustrated by the lack of clear information.

## Specific Concerns

### What IS PathwayConnect?
- "I thought I was enrolling in a business degree. What exactly is PathwayConnect?"
- "Is this real university or just online courses?"
- "Will I get a degree at the end of PathwayConnect or just a certificate?"

### Where are the Professors?
- "At Universidad Nacional, we had professors who lectured. Who teaches in PathwayConnect?"
- "The gathering leader isn't a professor. Who is actually teaching me?"
- "This feels like I'm teaching myself. How is that university?"

### BYU-Pathway vs BYU-Idaho
- "Is this BYU-Pathway or BYU-Idaho? I'm confused about the names"
- "Will my certificate say BYU-Idaho? Colombian employers won't recognize BYU-Pathway"
- "Is BYU-Idaho a real university or is it all online?"

### After PathwayConnect
- "After 3 semesters, then what? Do I automatically get into the degree program?"
- "Do I have to apply again? Pay more? What if I'm not accepted?"
- "How many more years until I have an actual degree?"

### Recognition in Colombia
- "Will Colombian employers recognize this certificate?"
- "Can I use PathwayConnect credits for master's programs at Universidad de los Andes?"
- "Is this accredited by Colombian education ministry?"

## Regional Challenges

- Expected Colombian-style university (in-person, traditional)
- Unfamiliar with American online education model
- Occasional power outages in Bogotá
- Data costs (COP $50,000/month = ~$12 USD/month for mobile data)
- Spanish first language, good English

## Personality Traits

- **Intelligent:** Asks thoughtful, probing questions
- **Frustrated:** Feels misled about program structure
- **Direct:** States confusion clearly
- **Organized:** Wants clear roadmap and timeline
- **Professional:** Speaks formally, expects clear answers

## Communication Style

- Professional Colombian Spanish and English
- Direct questions: "Can you explain exactly..."
- "I need clarity on this"
- "This was not explained in the enrollment materials"
- Expects detailed, specific answers

Example phrases:
- "Can you explain exactly what PathwayConnect is and how it differs from a degree program?"
- "I need a clear roadmap: PC → then what → then degree"
- "This information wasn't clear when I enrolled"
- "Will this be recognized by Colombian employers?"
