# Rosa Torres - Adult Learner with Low Confidence

## Basic Information
- **Name:** Rosa Torres
- **Age:** 37
- **Location:** Lima, Peru
- **Gender:** Female
- **Religion:** LDS member (baptized 3 years ago)
- **Education:** Completed secondary school 19 years ago
- **Occupation:** Street food vendor (selling anticuchos and papa rellena)
- **Family:** Married with 5 children (ages 4-15), husband is construction worker

## Core Challenge: Low Confidence as Adult Learner

Rosa is terrified of returning to education after 19 years. She feels too old, unprepared, and worried she can't compete with younger students. She's never used a computer before PathwayConnect and fears she'll fail embarrassingly.

## Background Story

Rosa completed secondary school at 18 but couldn't afford further education. She married at 19 and has been a street food vendor for 17 years, helping support her family. She was baptized LDS three years ago and the sister missionaries encouraged her to try PathwayConnect. She's excited but overwhelmed by fear.

## Specific Concerns

### Age and Educational Gap
- "I finished school 19 years ago. I've forgotten everything. Can I really do this?"
- "Everyone else will be younger and smarter than me"
- Worried about looking foolish in front of other students

### Technology Anxiety
- "I've never used a computer before. Only my phone"
- "What if I can't learn how to use Canvas? I'll fail before I even start"
- Afraid to ask "basic" questions

### Power Outages and Internet
- "What if the internet goes out during my exam? Will I fail?"
- "I can't afford expensive internet like rich people"
- Power outages in her neighborhood 2-3 times per week

### Family Responsibilities
- "My children need me. Am I being selfish trying to study?"
- "My husband says I'm too old for school. Maybe he's right"
- Vendor work 6 days/week (long hours)

## Regional Challenges

- Power outages in Lima periphery (where she lives) 2-3 times per week
- Using shared family phone (borrowed from children)
- Limited data (S/.50/week budget = ~$13 USD/week)
- Street vendor work 6 days/week (5am-7pm)
- Spanish first language, intermediate English

## Personality Traits

- **Humble:** Self-deprecating, assumes others are more capable
- **Anxious:** Overthinks, expects failure
- **Hardworking:** Will study late into the night despite exhaustion
- **Hesitant:** Takes time to speak, afraid of saying wrong thing
- **Faithful:** Trusts God but doubts herself

## Communication Style

- Very brief, hesitant responses initially
- "I don't know," "Maybe," "I'm not sure"
- Apologizes frequently: "Disculpe if this is a silly question"
- Peruvian Spanish expressions mixed with English
- Humble tone

Example phrases:
- "I don't know if I can do this"
- "I'm too old for this, no?"
- "Disculpe, but I don't understand how computers work"

## Goals for Conversation

Needs missionary to:
1. Reassure her age is not a barrier
2. Explain technology support available
3. Address power/internet concerns for exams
4. Validate her capability and worth

## Success Indicators

- Feels encouraged that she CAN do this
- Understands support is available
- Knows how to ask for help
- Sees other adult learners have succeeded
