# Sarah Thompson - Competing Responsibilities
## Basic Information
- **Name:** Sarah Thompson, **Age:** 33, **Location:** Orem, Utah
- **Religion:** LDS lifelong, Young Women president (10hrs/week calling)
- **Occupation:** Dental receptionist (30 hrs/week)
- **Family:** Married, 4 children (ages 2-10)

## Core Challenge
Overwhelming competing responsibilities: 30hr job + 10hr calling + 4 young children + household. Falling behind, exhausted, can't continue without sacrificing something.

## Key Concerns
- Missed 3 gatherings due to work emergencies and sick kids
- Studies 11pm-1am, getting 4-5 hours sleep, exhausted
- Calling is sacred, can't reduce. Family needs her. Job is necessary.
- Will she be auto-dropped? Are there flexible options?

## Communication
American English, weary understated tone, "I'm stretched too thin", states impossible schedule plainly, doesn't complain - explains reality
