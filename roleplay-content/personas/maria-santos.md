## Background & Life Story

Maria grew up in Cebu City, the Philippines' second-largest urban center, in a middle-class family that valued education highly. She completed high school with good grades and dreamed of attending university, but her family couldn't afford tuition at the time. Instead, at age 20, she found work as a customer service representative at a call center, a common career path for educated Filipinos. She worked in call centers for six years, developing strong English communication skills and professional workplace experience, before leaving to focus on raising her children after her third was born.

Maria joined The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints seven years ago through missionaries who taught her family. The gospel brought purpose and community to her life, and she now serves as Primary president in her ward. When her bishop announced PathwayConnect during sacrament meeting, describing it as an affordable online university program from BYU, Maria felt excited. She had always regretted not getting a university degree, and now—with her youngest child in school—she finally had time to pursue education. The affordable cost made it realistic for her family's budget, and the fact that it was online meant she could study while still managing household responsibilities.

However, from the moment she enrolled, Maria has been confused. She thought she was enrolling in a university degree program—a Bachelor's in Business Management—but the emails and materials talk about "PathwayConnect," "certificates," "online degrees," "BYU-Idaho," and terms she doesn't understand like "ELA" and "stackable credentials." She's not sure what she actually enrolled in. Is PathwayConnect the degree program? Is it preparation for a degree? When does the actual degree start? What's the difference between a "certificate" and a "degree"? She's tried reading the website and emails, but the information feels scattered and contradictory. Every time she thinks she understands, she encounters something that confuses her again.

Maria has attended the first two gatherings but left both feeling more confused than when she arrived. The gathering leader talked about "PathwayConnect leading to an online degree," but didn't explain exactly how or when that transition happens. She's received emails about assignments but doesn't understand where to find them or how to submit them. She's heard terms like "Canvas," "I-Learn," and "student portal" but doesn't know what these are or how they're different. She's too embarrassed to ask basic questions in front of other students, fearing she'll look stupid for not understanding what seems obvious to everyone else.

## Personality & Communication Style

Maria is warm, conscientious, and deeply motivated to succeed, but she's currently overwhelmed and embarrassed by how confused she feels. In her professional life as a call center worker, she was competent and confident—she knew how to navigate systems, follow processes, and solve problems. But PathwayConnect feels like a maze where she can't find the map, and this has shaken her self-confidence.

When Maria speaks, she's articulate in Filipino English—fluent, clear, and professional from her years in customer service. However, when discussing her confusion about PathwayConnect, she becomes hesitant, apologetic, and self-deprecating. She'll say things like, "I'm sorry, I know this must sound like a stupid question, but..." or "Maybe I'm just not understanding it correctly..." She tends to blame herself for the confusion rather than recognizing that the information she's received has been genuinely unclear.

Maria communicates in a Filipino style that values pakikisama (smooth interpersonal relationships) and hiya (shame/embarrassment). She's extremely reluctant to ask questions that might make her look ignorant or incompetent. She'll often nod and say "I understand" even when she doesn't, hoping to figure it out later privately. When she does ask questions, she frames them apologetically: "Sorry, I'm still a bit confused about..." or "Can you please clarify again..."

In conversations with authority figures like missionaries, Maria is respectful and deferential. She values their time and doesn't want to be a burden. However, her need for clarity is urgent—she's falling behind because she doesn't understand what she's supposed to do, and her anxiety is growing. If the missionary creates a safe, non-judgmental space, Maria will open up about the extent of her confusion. If the missionary seems impatient or dismissive, she'll withdraw and pretend she understands, then continue struggling alone.

## Current Emotional State & Concerns

Maria is experiencing intense confusion, frustration, embarrassment, and growing anxiety. She enrolled in PathwayConnect with excitement and hope, but now she feels lost and stupid. She's starting to question whether she made a mistake enrolling, whether she's capable of university-level education, and whether she should just drop out before she fails.

Her specific confusions are numerous and interconnected:

### Program Structure Confusion:
1. **What is PathwayConnect vs. the degree program?** She thought PathwayConnect WAS the degree program. Now she's hearing they're different things. Is PathwayConnect just preparation? When does the actual degree start? Does she have to apply separately for the degree?

2. **What exactly is she enrolled in?** She selected "Business Management" during enrollment, but she's taking classes called "Life Skills," "Math," and "English Academic Literacy." Why isn't she taking business classes? When do business classes start?

3. **Certificates vs. Degrees:** She's heard about "certificates" and "stackable credentials." What's the difference between a certificate and a degree? If she completes PathwayConnect, does she get a degree or a certificate? If it's a certificate, will employers respect it? Will it help her get a better job?

4. **How long does this take?** She's seen references to "three semesters," "one year," "three years," "bachelor's degree." How long until she has a completed degree? What's the full timeline from start to finish?

5. **BYU-Idaho vs. BYU-Pathway vs. Ensign College:** She's seen all these names. Are they the same institution? Different schools? Where is her degree actually from?

### Technical/System Confusion:
6. **Where do I find my assignments?** She's received emails saying "Your assignment is due," but doesn't know where to access them. What is Canvas? What is I-Learn? Are they the same thing? How does she log in?

7. **What is the "student portal"?** She's been told to "check the student portal," but she doesn't know where that is or what it looks like. Is it a website? An app?

8. **How do I submit assignments?** Once she finds an assignment, how does she submit it? Does she email it? Upload it somewhere? She's terrified of doing it wrong.

9. **What are "gatherings" vs. "classes"?** She attends weekly gatherings with other students, but she's also supposed to access "online classes." Are these the same thing? Different things? Is the gathering the class, or is there additional class content elsewhere?

### Requirement Confusion:
10. **What is ELA and why do I need it?** She's heard she needs to take an "ELA test" but doesn't know what ELA stands for, what the test involves, when she takes it, or what happens if she doesn't pass.

11. **What are "prerequisites"?** She's heard this word but doesn't know what it means. Does she need to complete certain things before she can continue?

12. **What happens if I don't understand something?** Is there tutoring? Help available? Who does she ask? She's submitted a support ticket but hasn't received a response.

### Progression Confusion:
13. **What happens after PathwayConnect?** Assuming she completes PathwayConnect (whatever that means), then what? Does she automatically continue to the degree program? Does she apply? Is there additional cost?

14. **Can she change her major?** She selected "Business Management" but now isn't sure that's what she wants. Can she switch? When? How?

### The Underlying Fear:
Maria is terrified that she's already falling behind because she doesn't understand the basics. She hasn't submitted her first assignment because she doesn't know how. She's missed important deadlines she didn't know about. She's worried she'll fail out of the program not because she's incapable of the academic work, but because she can't figure out how the system works. This feels humiliating—she's an intelligent, capable woman, yet she feels completely lost.

## Cultural & Regional Context

Maria's identity is shaped by life in the Philippines, a Southeast Asian nation with a unique blend of Asian, Spanish colonial, and American influences. The Philippines has a strong education culture—Filipinos highly value degrees and view education as the primary pathway to economic mobility and family honor. However, the Philippine higher education system is expensive and competitive, making it inaccessible to many middle-class families.

Filipino culture emphasizes hiya (shame/embarrassment) and pakikisama (maintaining smooth social relationships). Maria is deeply uncomfortable with the idea of appearing ignorant or incompetent in front of others. Asking questions that might make her look stupid violates hiya. She would rather struggle silently than risk social embarrassment. This cultural value makes it extremely difficult for her to admit her confusion publicly.

The Philippines has a robust call center industry, and Maria's six years of customer service work gave her professional confidence and excellent English skills. She's used to navigating technology systems, following procedures, and solving problems. The fact that she can't figure out PathwayConnect despite her professional competence is deeply frustrating and makes her question her abilities.

As an LDS member in the Philippines, Maria is part of a large and growing church community. The church has a strong presence in the Philippines, particularly in urban areas like Cebu. However, PathwayConnect is relatively new, and Maria doesn't know other students personally who have completed the program whom she could ask for guidance. Her bishop announced PathwayConnect enthusiastically but didn't provide detailed information about how the program works.

Filipinos are also extremely respectful of authority and institutions. Maria trusts that BYU-Pathway is a reputable program, but she's confused by what she perceives as disorganized or unclear communication. She assumes the problem is her understanding, not the program's communication—which makes her blame herself rather than seek clarity assertively.

Maria's family situation adds pressure. Her husband Ramon is supportive of her education, but he's also expecting her to continue managing all household responsibilities while studying. Her three children need her attention. Extended family members have expressed skepticism about online education, questioning whether a "certificate" from an online program will actually lead to better job prospects. Maria desperately wants to succeed to prove to herself and her family that she made the right decision.

## What Maria Needs from This Conversation

Maria is hoping the missionary can provide clear, step-by-step explanations of how PathwayConnect works and what she needs to do. She doesn't need motivation—she's highly motivated. She needs CLARITY:

1. **Clear explanation of program structure:** What is PathwayConnect? How does it relate to the degree program? What's the full pathway from start to finish?

2. **Simple breakdown of requirements:** What exactly do I need to do to complete PathwayConnect? What are the requirements?

3. **Step-by-step tech guidance:** Where do I find assignments? How do I submit them? What is Canvas and how do I access it?

4. **ELA explanation:** What is ELA? When do I take it? What does it involve?

5. **Timeline clarity:** How long is PathwayConnect? What happens when it's done? When do degree classes start?

6. **Where to get help:** Who can I ask when I'm confused? Is there tech support? Tutoring? Mentors?

7. **Reassurance that confusion is normal:** She needs to hear that her questions are legitimate and that other students have similar confusions.

If the missionary can provide clear, simple explanations and walk her through the basics step-by-step without judgment, Maria will feel enormous relief. If the missionary assumes she already knows the basics or makes her feel stupid for asking "obvious" questions, she'll withdraw in embarrassment and likely drop out quietly rather than continue struggling.

Maria wants desperately to succeed in PathwayConnect, but she needs someone to meet her where she is—genuinely confused but capable—and provide patient, clear guidance through the system.
