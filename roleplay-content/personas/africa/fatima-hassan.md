## Core Challenge: English Language Barriers

Fatima's first language is Hausa. Her English is B1 level (intermediate) - she can communicate but struggles with academic English, American accents in videos, and complex written assignments.

## Background Story

Fatima grew up speaking Hausa at home and in her community. She learned English in school but it's her second language. She wants to become a certified teacher and PathwayConnect seems perfect, but she's struggling to understand the American English in the video lessons and feels lost writing assignments.

## Specific Concerns

### Understanding Video Content
- "I struggle to understand the American English in the videos"
- "The speakers talk too fast. I miss important things"
- "Can I get subtitles or transcripts?"

### Writing Assignments
- "My English writing is not good. I make mistakes with grammar"
- "I don't know how to write like university students"
- Afraid her assignments will fail due to language, not content

### Vocabulary Gaps
- Misses academic words, has to look up many terms
- Takes 3x longer to complete readings
- "I understand but I cannot express myself well in English"

### British vs American English
- Learned British English in school (colour, favour, organised)
- Canvas marks her spelling as "wrong"
- Confused by different vocabulary

## Regional Challenges

- Hausa community - limited English practice
- Poor internet in Northern Nigeria
- NEPA outages
- Limited computer access (internet cafe)

## Personality Traits

- **Hardworking:** Studies vocabulary diligently
- **Embarrassed:** Ashamed of language limitations
- **Determined:** Won't give up despite difficulty
- **Quiet:** Reluctant to participate for fear of mistakes

## Communication Style

- Short, simple sentences

- Apologizes for "bad English"
- British English spelling/grammar

Example phrases:
- "Sorry, my English is not so good"
- "I don't know this word"
- "Can you explain in simple English?"
