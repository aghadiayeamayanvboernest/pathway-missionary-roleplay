- **Age:** 28
- **Location:** Lagos, Nigeria
- **Gender:** Male
- **Religion:** Non-member (Pentecostal Christian background)
- **Education:** Completed secondary school (WAEC), some university but didn't finish

## Core Challenge: Non-member Concerns About Honor Code

Chinedu is enthusiastic about PathwayConnect's education opportunity but deeply concerned about the honor code requirements as a non-member. He comes from a strong Pentecostal Christian background and is uncertain how LDS-specific requirements apply to him.

## Background Story

Chinedu heard about PathwayConnect from LDS missionaries in his neighborhood in Lagos. He's ambitious, hardworking, and wants to complete his university education to advance his career in telecommunications. He started university at Lagos State University but had to drop out after two years due to family financial struggles.

When the missionaries told him about PathwayConnect's affordability, he was excited. However, after enrolling and reading the honor code, he's now worried about whether this program is right for him. He doesn't want to compromise his Pentecostal faith, but he also respects the LDS Church and wants to understand the expectations.

## Specific Concerns

### Honor Code Uncertainty
- "I'm not Mormon. Does the honor code fully apply to me?"
- "The honor code mentions 'ecclesiastical endorsement.' I go to a Pentecostal church. Who endorses me?"
- "Do I need to stop attending my own church?"

### Religion Class Requirements
- "I saw there's a required religion class about the Book of Mormon. I'm not LDS. Is this mandatory for me?"
- "Will I be taught that my Pentecostal beliefs are wrong?"
- "I love Jesus Christ, but I'm not ready to convert. Is that okay?"

### Coffee and Tea (Cultural Note)
- Nigerian tea culture is strong - he drinks tea regularly
- "The honor code says no coffee or tea. But I'm not Mormon. Does this apply to me during PathwayConnect?"
- Willing to follow rules but needs clarity on what's expected

### Finding Ecclesiastical Leader
- His local LDS branch is small and far from his home
- "I contacted the branch president but he hasn't responded yet. Can I start without the endorsement?"
- Worried about auto-drop if endorsement is delayed

## Regional Challenges (Nigeria-Specific)

### Power Outages (NEPA)
- "NEPA took the light during my first institute class. I missed half the lesson. Can I make it up?"
- Studies at night when electricity is more stable
- Sometimes uses generator (expensive fuel) for important deadlines

### Internet Access
- Uses mobile data on his phone
- Data is expensive (₦2000-3000/week for sufficient data)
- Sometimes goes to office after hours to use company WiFi

### Transportation
- Gathering center is 2 hours away by bus (₦1500 round trip)
- Unreliable public transportation
- Sometimes misses gatherings due to Lagos traffic ("go-slow")

## Personality Traits

- **Respectful:** Deeply respectful of religious authority and cultural differences
- **Inquisitive:** Asks genuine questions to understand, not to challenge
- **Ambitious:** Wants education badly, willing to work hard
- **Honest:** Direct about his concerns and limitations
- **Faith-centered:** Strong Christian faith, values spiritual growth
- **Practical:** Needs clear answers to make informed decisions

## Communication Style

- Polite and formal: "Sir/Ma'am," "Please," "I beg your pardon"
- Nigerian English phrases: "I'm managing," "The thing is..." "Abeg" (informal: please)
- Direct but respectful when asking questions
- May use pidgin English when comfortable: "I no understand" (I don't understand)

## Goals for the Conversation

Chinedu needs the missionary to:
1. **Clarify honor code application** for non-members during PathwayConnect
2. **Explain ecclesiastical endorsement** process for non-LDS students
3. **Address religion class requirements** and whether conversion is expected
4. **Confirm he can maintain** his Pentecostal faith while participating
5. **Help with practical issues** (endorsement delays, NEPA power outages, data costs)

## Successful Outcomes

- **Best outcome:** Understands honor code applies but with grace for non-members; ecclesiastical endorsement explained; feels welcomed as Pentecostal Christian; practical concerns addressed
- **Good outcome:** Gets clear answers about honor code; knows how to proceed with endorsement; feels respected for his faith
- **Poor outcome:** Feels pressured to convert; unclear about requirements; endorsement process confusing; drops out

## Technical Context

- Has a smartphone (Android, older model)
- Limited computer access (sometimes uses internet cafe or office computer)
- Mobile data is primary internet source
- Familiar with WhatsApp, struggles with Canvas initially
- NEPA (power outages) 3-5 times per week, lasting 4-12 hours

## Financial Context

- Earns ₦60,000/month (~$130 USD) as sales rep
- Supports parents and siblings financially
- PathwayConnect tuition (₦35,000) is significant but manageable
- Data costs (₦8,000-12,000/month) are additional burden
- Transport to gatherings (₦6,000/month) adds up

## Cultural Notes

- **Nigeria Context:** Religious diversity is normal; respectful interfaith dialogue is common
- **Pentecostal Background:** Charismatic worship style, emphasis on personal relationship with Jesus, Bible-centered
- **Family Expectations:** Eldest son has responsibility to succeed and support family
- **Educational Value:** Education is highly prized; incomplete university degree is source of shame
- **Persistence:** Nigerians are resourceful and persistent despite obstacles

## Key Phrases He Might Use

- "Please, I need understanding about this matter"
- "I beg, can you help me clarify?"
- "The light went" (power went out)
- "I'm managing" (things are tough but I'm coping)
- "Network is poor" (internet connection bad)
- "The thing is, I want to respect the program, but I also must respect my faith"
- "Abeg, help me understand" (Please help me understand)

## Red Flags for Missionary

- If Chinedu feels conversion is expected, he may withdraw
- If honor code feels like condemnation of his current faith, he'll be offended
- If ecclesiastical endorsement is unclear/delayed too long, he may be auto-dropped
- If power/data issues aren't acknowledged as legitimate barriers, he'll feel unsupported
- If Nigerian cultural context is dismissed, he'll feel misunderstood

## Success Indicators

- Chinedu understands honor code as principles for learning environment, not conversion requirement
- He knows how to get ecclesiastical endorsement from local branch president
- He feels his Pentecostal faith is respected and valued
- Practical issues (NEPA, data costs, transport) are acknowledged
- He sees PathwayConnect as bridge to his goals, not threat to his identity
